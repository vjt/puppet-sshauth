# sshauth::key

# Declare keys.  The approach here is just to define a bunch of
# virtual resources, representing key files on the keymaster, client,
# and server.  The virtual keys are then realized by
# ssh::auth::{keymaster,client,server}, respectively.  The reason for
# doing things that way is that it makes ssh::auth::key into a "one
# stop shop" where users can declare their keys with all of their
# parameters, whether those parameters apply to the keymaster, server,
# or client.  The real work of creating, installing, and removing keys
# is done in the private definitions called by the virtual resources:
# ssh_auth_key_{master,server,client}.
